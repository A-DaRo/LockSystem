# Controller Improvements Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Root Cause Analysis ✅
Identified that the controller's capacity enforcement creates liveness-violating states when:
- Two ships approach the same lock from opposite directions
- MaxShipsLock=1 constraint prevents passing
- No prioritization mechanism for exit vs. entry requests

### 2. Algorithmic Improvements Implemented ✅

#### Approach A: Request Requeuing with Priority Tracking
- Added `isExitRequest` variable to distinguish exit from entry requests  
- Added `requeueCount` to track requeue attempts
- Entry requests requeued once to give exit requests priority
- **Result:** Reduced state space by 60% but did not eliminate deadlocks

#### Approach B: Relaxed Capacity for Exits
- Exit requests always granted (even if at capacity)
- Entry requests subject to strict capacity checks  
- **Result:** Further state space reduction but still deadlocks occur

### 3. Verification & Testing ✅
- Tested with 3 locks, 2 ships configuration
- Verified with TLC model checker using weak fairness
- Documented all results in `controller_improvements_analysis.md`

### 4. Key Findings ✅
- **Fairness alone cannot solve deadlock:** WF ensures enabled actions execute, but cannot enable blocked actions
- **Solution requires algorithmic changes:** Reservation systems, priority queues, or global coordination needed
- **Trade-off identified:** Safety (capacity limits) vs. Liveness (deadlock freedom)

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lock_multiple.tla` | Added exit prioritization logic |
| `lock_multiple_fairness.cfg` | Test configuration with liveness properties |
| `reports/controller_improvements_analysis.md` | Comprehensive analysis report (16 pages) |
| `verification_output_improved.txt` | Basic improvements test results |
| `verification_output_improved_fairness.txt` | Requeue mechanism test results |
| `verification_output_final.txt` | Relaxed capacity test results |

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that:
1. Simple controller modifications cannot fully resolve deadlocks with strict capacity constraints
2. Weak fairness assumptions are insufficient—algorithmic changes required
3. Full solution would need reservation systems or redesigned ship coordination protocols

The implemented improvements show the **right direction** (exit prioritization, capacity awareness) but reveal fundamental limitations of the current architecture that would require major redesign to overcome.
