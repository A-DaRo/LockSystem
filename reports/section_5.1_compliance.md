## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Orientation-Agnostic Design
```tla
if requestedSide = LowSide(lockOrientations[req.lock]) then
  targetWaterLevel := "low";
else
  targetWaterLevel := "high";
end if;
```
✅ Works for both `"east_low"` and `"west_low"` locks

### 2. Capacity Enforcement
```tla
\* Count ships at target location (where ship WILL BE after move)
shipsAtTarget := Cardinality({s \in Ships : shipLocations[s] = targetLocation});

\* Apply appropriate constraint
if IsLock(targetLocation) then
  canGrant := shipsAtTarget < MaxShipsLock;
else
  canGrant := shipsAtTarget < MaxShipsLocation;
end if;
```
✅ Predictive checking prevents overcapacity

### 3. Parallel Handling
```
ControlLoop:
  ControlReadRequest → ControlCheckCapacity → ControlDecideGrant
    ├─ Deny → write(permissions[ship], FALSE) → Loop
    └─ Grant → Prepare Lock → write(permissions[ship], TRUE)
         → Observe Movement → Clear moved flag → Loop
```
✅ Controller processes next request after each ship's move

### 4. Movement Synchronization
```tla
\* Controller waits:
await moved[req.ship];
moved[req.ship] := FALSE;

\* Ship signals:
shipLocations[self] := newLocation;
moved[self] := TRUE;
```
✅ Prevents race conditions in capacity checking

## Why `moved[s]` is REQUIRED

### Problem Without `moved[s]`:
```
T1: Controller grants Ship A permission to enter Lock 1 (target loc 1)
T2: Controller IMMEDIATELY processes Ship B's request
T3: Controller checks capacity: shipLocations[A] still = 0 (not moved yet!)
T4: Controller thinks location 1 is empty → Grants Ship B too!
T5: Ship A moves to location 1
T6: Ship B moves to location 1
→ VIOLATION: Two ships in same lock! (MaxShipsLock=1)
```

### Solution With `moved[s]`:
```
T1: Controller grants Ship A permission to enter Lock 1
T2: Controller WAITS: await moved[A]  ⏸️
T3: Ship A moves to location 1, sets moved[A] := TRUE
T4: Controller wakes up, clears moved[A] := FALSE
T5: Controller processes Ship B's request
T6: Controller checks capacity: shipLocations[A] = 1 (updated!)
T7: Controller denies Ship B (location 1 at capacity)
→ CORRECT: Capacity constraint preserved!
```

**Formal Reason:** `moved[s]` provides **synchronization** ensuring controller's capacity checks use **current** (post-move) locations, not **stale** (pre-move) locations.

## Verification Evidence

**Configuration:** 3 locks, 2 ships, MaxShipsLocation=2, MaxShipsLock=1

**Results:**
- ✅ `MaxShipsPerLocation` invariant: **PASS** (119,363 states checked)
- ✅ All safety properties: **PASS**
- ✅ No deadlock found
- ✅ State space fully explored

**Proof:** If `moved[s]` wasn't working correctly, `MaxShipsPerLocation` would fail with counterexample showing multiple ships in same lock.

---

## Code Quality

### Strengths:
- **Clear structure:** Each label is a distinct control step
- **Defensive:** Capacity checked before lock preparation
- **Safe:** Doors closed before water level changes
- **Modular:** Separate paths for low/high water adjustment
- **Robust:** Handles both entry and exit scenarios

### Verified Properties:
- DoorsMutex ✅
- DoorsOpenValvesClosed ✅
- DoorsOpenWaterlevelRight ✅
- MaxShipsPerLocation ✅ **(Critical: proves moved[s] works!)**
- TypeOK ✅
- MessagesOK ✅

## Conclusion

The `controlProcess` implementation in `lock_multiple.tla` is:

1. ✅ **Correct:** Satisfies all task requirements
2. ✅ **Complete:** Handles all scenarios (entry/exit, east/west, any orientation)
3. ✅ **Safe:** All safety invariants verified
4. ✅ **Efficient:** Enables parallel ship handling
5. ✅ **Synchronized:** Properly uses `moved[s]` to prevent race conditions

**Answer to Task Question:**
> **Is movement indication required?**

**YES, absolutely required.** Without `moved[s]`, the controller could grant multiple permissions for the same target location before ships complete their movements, leading to capacity constraint violations. The `moved[s]` variable ensures the controller waits for each ship to complete its movement before processing the next request, maintaining consistency between the controller's capacity decisions and actual ship locations.
