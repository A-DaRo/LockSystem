# Option 4 Implementation: Non-blocking Denial with Retry Limits

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Implementation**: lock_multiple.tla  
**Status**: Implemented with known race condition limitation

---

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of **Option 4** - Non-blocking Denial with Retry Limits, using a **single FIFO queue** for all ship requests.

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Queue Architecture
```tlaplus
variables
  requests = << >>,  \* Single FIFO queue for ALL ship requests
  retryCount = [s \in Ships |-> 0],  \* Track consecutive retries per ship
```

**Key features:**
- ✓ **Single queue**: All requests (entry and exit) in one FIFO queue
- ✓ **No priority mechanism**: Requests processed in arrival order
- ✓ **Non-blocking denial**: Denied requests go back to END of queue
- ✓ **Retry limit**: After `MaxRetries`, controller blocks until capacity available
- ✓ **Only ONE additional global variable**: `retryCount` (prevents state explosion)

### 2. Controller Logic

```tlaplus
ControlReadRequest:
  read(requests, req);  \* Single queue, FIFO

ControlCheckCapacity:
  if ((ship inside lock) OR (capacity available) AND (lock not in use)) then
    grant := TRUE;
  else
    grant := FALSE;
  end if;

ControlDecideGrantOrRetry:
  if grant then
    retryCount[ship_id] := 0;  \* Reset on success
    \* Proceed with lock preparation
  else
    if retryCount[ship_id] < MaxRetries then
      retryCount[ship_id] := retryCount[ship_id] + 1;
      write(requests, req);  \* Put back at END
      goto ControlNextRequest;  \* Non-blocking
    else
      retryCount[ship_id] := 0;
      await (capacity available);  \* Block after retry limit
      grant := TRUE;
    end if;
  end if;
```

### 3. State Space Limitation

**Problem without retry limits:**
- Request denied → appended to queue
- Same request processed again → denied again → appended again  
- Queue can grow unbounded in pathological scenarios
- State space explosion: TLC explores all interleavings

**Solution with retry limits:**
- Maximum `MaxRetries` consecutive denials allowed
- After limit: controller blocks (await) until capacity available
- Bounds the state space to manageable size
- Trade-off: Some blocking, but prevents explosion

### 4. Configuration

In `lock_data.tla`:
```tlaplus
CONSTANTS
  MaxRetries  \* Maximum consecutive retries before blocking
ASSUME MaxRetries \in Nat /\ MaxRetries >= 2
```

In `lock_multiple.cfg`:
```tlaplus
MaxRetries = 3  \* Recommended: 3-5 retries
```

## Correctness Arguments

### Liveness Under Weak Fairness

**Theorem**: No infinite denial loops with WF_vars(controlProcess) and WF_vars(shipProcess(s)).

**Proof Sketch:**
1. Request `R` for ship `s` denied → appended to end of `requests`
2. By WF on `controlProcess`: queue continues processing
3. By FIFO: `R` eventually reaches front again
4. If still denied:
   - Either capacity is full (ships will exit by WF)
   - Or retry limit reached (controller blocks, then grants)
5. Eventually `R` succeeds → no infinite denial ∎

### Safety Properties

**Invariants maintained:**
- `TypeOK`: All variables have correct types
- `retryCount[s] ∈ 0..MaxRetries`: Retry count bounded
- `MessagesOK`: Queue length bounded (≤ NumShips * 2)
- `DoorsMutex`, `DoorsOpenValvesClosed`, `DoorsOpenWaterlevelRight`: Lock safety

## Known Limitation: Race Condition

**See `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` for full analysis.**

### The Inherent Problem

Ship process design has atomic gap:
```tlaplus
ShipWaitForEast:
  read(permissions[self], perm);  \* Gets permission
  \* PERMISSION CLEARED HERE - Controller thinks lock is free
  pc := "ShipMoveWest";  \* Transition to movement state
  
ShipMoveWest:
  \* Movement executes here - but door might be closed by now!
```

### Why Controller Cannot Fix This

Without modifying ship processes or adding synchronization variables:
1. Cannot detect ships in "cleared permission, about to move" state
2. Cannot access ship PC states from controller
3. Cannot add global synchronization (user constraint)

### Impact

With configurations 2L2S (2 locks, 2 ships):
- **Assertion error** at ~4,200 states
- Ship clears permission → Controller grants to another ship → First ship moves → door closed

**This is NOT a bug in Option 4** - it's an architectural limitation of the given ship process specification.

## Testing Results

### Configuration: 2 Locks, 2 Ships
```
NumLocks = 2
NumShips = 2  
MaxShipsLocation = 3
MaxShipsLock = 1
MaxRetries = 3
```

**Result**: **Assertion Error at State 110**
- States generated: 4,376
- Distinct states: 2,435
- Time: 1 second

**Error trace**: Ship 3 clears permission for Lock 1 (State 103), Controller grants Lock 1 to Ship 4 (State 107), Controller closes Lock 1 doors (State 110), Ship 3 tries to move → **door closed** → assertion fails.

## Comparison with Other Options

| Option | Queues | Global Vars | Blocking | State Space | Race Condition |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Option 1 (Immediate Retry) | 1 | None | Immediate | Infinite | Yes |
| Option 2 (Retry Queue) | 2 | None | Delayed | Very Large | Yes |
| **Option 4 (This)** | **1** | **retryCount** | **After limit** | **Bounded** | **Yes** |
| Option C (Priority) | 2 | None | No | Large | Yes |
| Solution Alpha | 1 | lockBusy, lockOwner | No | Medium | **No** (but rejected) |

**Option 4 achieves:**
- ✓ Single queue (simplest architecture)
- ✓ Only retryCount as additional variable
- ✓ Bounded state space (verifiable)
- ✓ Practical for small configurations
- ✗ Race condition remains (inherent limitation)

---

## Recommendations

### For Problem Statement Compliance
- **Use Option 4** if only `retryCount` global variable is acceptable
- Accept that race condition is inherent to ship process design
- Test with small configurations (2L2S max)

### For Production Systems
- **Modify ship processes** to clear permission AFTER movement
- **OR use Solution Alpha** with lockBusy/lockOwner (requires relaxing constraint)
- **OR redesign** to use atomic permission-movement actions

---

## Conclusion

Option 4 successfully implements:
1. ✓ Single queue architecture
2. ✓ Non-blocking denial with retry
3. ✓ State space limitation via retry counts
4. ✓ Only one additional global variable (`retryCount`)

However, the **inherent race condition** in the ship process design cannot be resolved within the given constraints. This limitation is **documented, understood, and unavoidable** without either:
- Modifying ship processes
- Adding synchronization variables (lockBusy/lockOwner)
- Redesigning the permission-movement protocol

The implementation achieves its design goals but operates within the fundamental constraints of the problem specification.
