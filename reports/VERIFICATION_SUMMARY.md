# TLA+ Model Verification Summary
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**TLC Version:** 2.19 (August 8, 2024)

## Overview
All model checking tests completed successfully with **NO ERRORS FOUND** ✅

---

## Test 1: Single Lock System Model
**Configuration File:** `lock_single.cfg`  
**Model File:** `lock_system.tla` (extending `lock_single.tla`)  
**Test Command:** `java -jar tla2tools.jar -config lock_single.cfg lock_system.tla`

### Constants
```
NumLocks = 1
NumShips = 1
MaxShipsLocation = 2
MaxShipsLock = 1
```

### Specification
- **SPECIFICATION:** FairSpec (with fairness assumptions)

### Results ✅ PASS
- **Status:** Model checking completed. No error has been found.
- **States Generated:** 182
- **Distinct States:** 154
- **Queue Remaining:** 0
- **Search Depth:** 128
- **Execution Time:** < 1 second

### Safety Properties Verified (Invariants)
✅ **TypeOK** - All variables maintain correct types  
✅ **MessagesOK** - Message queues do not overflow (≤ 1 message)  
✅ **DoorsMutex** - West and east doors never open simultaneously  
✅ **DoorsOpenValvesClosed** - Doors only open when water level is correct  
✅ **DoorsOpenWaterlevelRight** - Water level matches door side when doors open  

### Liveness Properties Verified (Temporal)
✅ **RequestLockFulfilled** - Ship requests eventually result in lock access  
✅ **WaterlevelChange** - Water level changes when needed  
✅ **RequestsShips** - Ships continue making requests (infinitely often)  
✅ **ShipsReachGoals** - Ships eventually reach their destination  

### Deadlock Check
✅ **No deadlock detected**

---

## Test 2: Multiple Lock System Model
**Configuration File:** `lock_multiple.cfg`  
**Model File:** `lock_system.tla` (extending `lock_multiple.tla`)  
**Test Command:** `java -jar tla2tools.jar -config lock_multiple.cfg lock_system.tla`

### Constants
```
NumLocks = 2
NumShips = 2
MaxShipsLocation = 2
MaxShipsLock = 1
```

### Specification
- **SPECIFICATION:** FairSpec (with fairness assumptions)

### Results ✅ PASS
- **Status:** Model checking completed. No error has been found.
- **States Generated:** 78,260
- **Distinct States:** 38,449
- **Queue Remaining:** 0
- **Search Depth:** 719
- **Average Outdegree:** 1 (min: 0, max: 3, 95th percentile: 2)
- **Execution Time:** 11 seconds

### Safety Properties Verified (Invariants)
✅ **TypeOK** - All variables maintain correct types  
✅ **MessagesOK** - Message queues do not overflow  
✅ **DoorsMutex** - For each lock, west and east doors never open simultaneously  
✅ **DoorsOpenValvesClosed** - Doors only open when appropriate valves are closed  
✅ **DoorsOpenWaterlevelRight** - Water level matches door side for all locks  
✅ **MaxShipsPerLocation** - Location capacity constraints respected (≤2 ships outside, ≤1 ship in lock)  

### Liveness Properties Verified (Temporal)
✅ **RequestLockFulfilled** - All ship requests eventually processed  
✅ **WaterlevelChange** - Water levels change when needed for each lock  
✅ **RequestsShips** - All ships continue making requests  
✅ **ShipsReachGoals** - All ships eventually reach their destinations  

### Deadlock Check
✅ **No deadlock detected**

## Fairness Assumptions
Both models use **FairSpec** which includes:
- **Weak Fairness (WF)** on the control process: `WF_vars(controlProcess)`
- Ensures continuously enabled actions eventually execute
- Prevents starvation of ship requests
- Guarantees progress in lock operations

---

## State Space Exploration
| Model | States Generated | Distinct States | Search Depth | Time |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| Single Lock (1 lock, 1 ship) | 182 | 154 | 128 | <1s |
| Multiple Locks (2 locks, 2 ships) | 78,260 | 38,449 | 719 | 11s |

---

## Fingerprint Collision Probability
- **Single Lock:** 2.3E-16 (negligible)
- **Multiple Locks:** 8.3E-11 (negligible)

Both values indicate extremely low probability that TLC missed any reachable states due to fingerprint collisions.

---

## Conclusion
✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED**

Both the single lock system and multiple lock system satisfy:
1. All safety invariants (system never enters unsafe state)
2. All liveness properties (system makes progress and completes goals)
3. Deadlock freedom (system never gets stuck)

The models are **formally verified** and ready for submission.

## Files Verified
- `lock_data.tla` - Common data structures and constants
- `lock_single.tla` - Single lock/ship implementation
- `lock_multiple.tla` - Multiple locks/ships implementation
- `lock_system.tla` - Main entry point (toggle between models)
- `lock_single.cfg` - Configuration for single lock model
- `lock_multiple.cfg` - Configuration for multiple locks model

---

## How to Run Tests
```powershell
# Single Lock Model
java -jar tla2tools.jar -config lock_single.cfg lock_system.tla

# Multiple Lock Model
java -jar tla2tools.jar -config lock_multiple.cfg lock_system.tla
```

**Note:** Toggle `EXTENDS lock_single` vs `EXTENDS lock_multiple` in `lock_system.tla` to match the model being tested.
