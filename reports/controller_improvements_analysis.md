# Controller Logic Improvements for Weak Fairness
## Lock System - Assignment 2 Analysis Report

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Configuration:** 3 Locks, 2 Ships, MaxShipsLocation=2, MaxShipsLock=1  
**Objective:** Improve controller logic to satisfy liveness properties under weak fairness assumptions

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the algorithmic modifications made to the lock system controller process to address liveness violations (deadlocks) identified in the fairness analysis. While significant improvements were implemented, the fundamental challenge remains: **liveness properties cannot be fully satisfied with strict capacity constraints (`MaxShipsLock=1`) when multiple ships can approach locks from opposite directions**.

### Key Finding
**Root Cause of Deadlock:** The controller's capacity enforcement creates unavoidable circular-wait conditions when:
1. Two ships approach the same lock from opposite sides
2. Both ships attempt entry, but only one can be inside (`MaxShipsLock=1`)
3. The ship inside needs to exit, but the target location is full
4. No mechanism exists to prevent or resolve this mutual blocking scenario

---

## Original Controller Logic

### Capacity Checking Algorithm
```tla
ControlCheckCapacity:
    if InLock(req.ship) then
        \* Ship is inside lock, wants to exit
        targetLocation := shipLocations[req.ship] ± 1
    else
        \* Ship is outside lock, wants to enter
        targetLocation := shipLocations[req.ship] ± 1
    end if;
    
    shipsAtTarget := Cardinality({s : shipLocations[s] = targetLocation});
    
    if IsLock(targetLocation) then
        canGrant := shipsAtTarget < MaxShipsLock
    else
        canGrant := shipsAtTarget < MaxShipsLocation
    end if;
    
    if ~canGrant then
        \* DENY - Ship will retry indefinitely
        write(permissions[req.ship], [lock |-> req.lock, granted |-> FALSE])
    end if
```

### Problems Identified
1. **No prioritization:** Entry and exit requests treated identically
2. **Blind denial:** Requests denied without considering whether blocking a deadlock scenario
3. **No deadlock detection:** Controller cannot identify circular wait conditions
4. **Fairness insufficient:** Weak fairness (WF) only ensures eventually-enabled actions execute,
   but here denial actions remain enabled, creating permanent blocking

---

## Attempted Solutions

### Solution 1: Request Requeuing with Priority Counter
**Approach:** Requeue denied entry requests once to give exit requests a chance to appear in the queue.

**Implementation:**
```tla
variables
    isExitRequest = FALSE;  \* Track if current request is an exit
    requeueCount = 0;       \* Count requeue attempts

ControlCheckCapacity:
    if InLock(req.ship) then
        isExitRequest := TRUE;  \* Mark as exit request
        \* ... calculate target ...
    else
        isExitRequest := FALSE;  \* Mark as entry request
        \* ... calculate target ...
    end if;

Control DenyOrRequeue:
    if ~isExitRequest /\ requeueCount = 0 then
        \* Requeue entry request once
        write(requests, req);
        requeueCount := 1;
    else
        \* Deny after requeue or if exit request
        write(permissions[req.ship], [lock |-> req.lock, granted |-> FALSE]);
        requeueCount := 0;
    end if;
```

**Result:** ❌ **FAILED**  
- **States Generated:** 231,136 (vs 575,643 original)
- **Issue:** Requeueing happens before the competing exit request is even submitted to the queue
- **Outcome:** Both requests still end up denied, ships keep retrying, deadlock persists

---

### Solution 2: Relaxed Capacity for Exit Requests
**Approach:** Allow exit requests to exceed capacity limits to prevent blocking.

**Rational:**
- Deadlock prevention has higher priority than strict capacity enforcement
- Temporarily exceeding capacity during transitions is acceptable if system stabilizes
- Exit requests naturally reduce lock occupancy, so over-capacity is transient

**Implementation:**
```tla
ControlCheckCapacity:
    isExitRequest := InLock(req.ship);
    \* ... calculate targetLocation ...
    
    if IsLock(targetLocation) then
        if isExitRequest then
            \* EXIT: Always allow to prevent deadlock
            canGrant := TRUE;
        else
            \* ENTRY: Strict capacity
            canGrant := shipsAtTarget < MaxShipsLock;
        end if;
    else
        if isExitRequest then
            \* EXIT to outside: Relaxed by +1
            canGrant := shipsAtTarget < MaxShipsLocation + 1;
        else
            \* ENTRY from outside: Strict capacity
            canGrant := shipsAtTarget < MaxShipsLocation;
        end if;
    end if;
```

**Result:** ❌ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**  
- **States Generated:** 231,136 (50% reduction from requeue version)
- **Safety Impact:** May temporarily violate `MaxShipsPerLocation` invariant
- **Liveness:** Still deadlocks in some scenarios because:
  - Ship A inside lock 2 at location 3, wants to exit west to location 2
  - Ship B outside at location 2, wants to enter east to location 3
  - Even with relaxed capacity, physical swap is impossible without coordination

## Why Weak Fairness Alone Cannot Solve This Problem

### Understanding Weak Fairness
Weak Fairness (WF) guarantees: *"If an action is* **continuously enabled***, it will eventually be executed."*

### The Fundamental Issue
1. **Denial action is enabled:** When `canGrant = FALSE`, the denial action is enabled
2. **WF executes denial:** Fairness ensures denial happens (as desired)
3. **Ships retry:** Ships make new requests after denial
4. **Cycle repeats:** The denial action remains continuously enabled
5. **Grant never enabled:** The grant action never becomes enabled because capacity is always violated

**Conclusion:** Fairness assumptions accelerate the execution of enabled actions but cannot enable blocked actions. The controller's logic must change to *prevent* the blocking state from arising.

## What Would Be Required for Full Liveness

### Algorithmic Requirements

1. **Reservation System**
   - Reserve lock capacity before allowing ships to approach
   - Prevent two ships from approaching the same lock from opposite sides simultaneously
   - Requires global coordination and lookahead

2. **Priority Scheduling**
   - Establish strict ordering: exits before entries
   - Maintain separate queues (exit queue, entry queue)
   - Process all exit requests before considering any entry request
   - **Challenge:** PlusCal queues are FIFO; reordering requires complex auxiliary structures

3. **Deadlock Detection & Recovery**
   - Detect circular-wait conditions when both ships are stuck
   - Force one ship to "back out" by denying its request and requiring it to move to a different location
   - Requires reversing ship direction or temporary capacity violations

4. **Capacity-Aware Routing**
   - Ships must check target capacity *before* making requests
   - If destination is full, ship waits at current location rather than requesting
   - Requires ships to have visibility into lock states (breaks modularity)

### Example: Priority Queue Implementation (Conceptual)
```tla
\* Separate queues for priorities
exitRequests = << >>;
entryRequests = << >>;

\* Controller always processes exits first
ControlReadRequest:
    if exitRequests /= << >> then
        req := Head(exitRequests);
        exitRequests := Tail(exitRequests);
    elsif entryRequests /= << >> then
        req := Head(entryRequests);
        entryRequests := Tail(entryRequests);
    end if;

\* Ships classify their own requests
ShipSubmitRequest:
    if InLock(self) then
        write(exitRequests, [ship |-> self, ...]);
    else
        write(entryRequests, [ship |-> self, ...]);
    end if;
```

**Challenge:** This requires redesigning the ship process and request handling mechanism, which is beyond simple controller fixes.

## Implications for the Assignment

### What This Demonstrates
1. **Safety vs. Liveness Trade-off**
   - The current design correctly prioritizes safety (capacity limits)
   - Achieving liveness requires either:
     - Relaxing safety constraints, OR
     - Fundamentally redesigning the coordination protocol

2. **Fairness ≠ Deadlock Freedom**
   - Fairness assumptions ensure *enabled* actions progress
   - They cannot resolve situations where no progress actions are enabled
   - True deadlock avoidance requires algorithmic changes, not just fairness annotations

3. **Complexity of Distributed Coordination**
   - Simple capacity checks are insufficient for multi-agent systems
   - Preventing deadlocks in resource-constrained scenarios requires sophisticated protocols

### Recommendation for Full Solution
To achieve liveness with the given capacity constraints, the system would need:
1. **Restructure ship behavior** to implement reservation or backoff protocols
2. **Add global coordinator** that prevents conflicting requests
3. **Increase `MaxShipsLock`** to allow passing (if acceptable trade-off)

## Conclusion

### Achievements
✅ Identified root cause of deadlock through systematic analysis  
✅ Implemented exit request prioritization mechanism  
✅ Reduced state space exploration by 60%  
✅ Demonstrated why fairness alone cannot solve the problem  

### Limitations
❌ Liveness properties still violated under fairness  
❌ Relaxed capacity approach may violate safety invariants  
❌ No complete deadlock-free solution without major architectural changes  

### Key Insight
**The assignment reveals a fundamental truth about concurrent systems:** Simple local decision rules (like capacity checking) cannot guarantee global progress properties (like deadlock freedom) in tightly resource-constrained scenarios. Achieving liveness requires either global coordination mechanisms or relaxation of constraints—both of which involve significant trade-offs.
