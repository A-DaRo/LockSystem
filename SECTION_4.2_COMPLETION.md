**Assignment:** Software Specification (2IX20) - Assignment 2  
**Section:** 4.2 Property Verification

---

## âœ… Requirements Checklist

### â–¡ Formalize Properties (Lines 69-82 in lock_single.tla)

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

All dummy properties have been replaced with correct TLA+ formulas:

| Property | Line Range | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| DoorsMutex | ~70 | âœ… Formalized |
| DoorsOpenValvesClosed | ~73-75 | âœ… Formalized |
| DoorsOpenWaterlevelRight | ~78-80 | âœ… Formalized |
| RequestLockFulfilled | ~83-84 | âœ… Formalized |
| WaterlevelChange | ~87-89 | âœ… Formalized |
| RequestsShips | ~92 | âœ… Formalized |
| ShipsReachGoals | ~95-97 | âœ… Formalized |

---

### â–¡ Check Deadlock-Free

**Requirement:** "Check that the model is deadlock-free. TLA+ can automatically check for the presence of deadlocks in the model."

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

- **Configuration:** `CHECK_DEADLOCK TRUE` in model_single/MC.cfg
- **Result:** No deadlocks detected
- **Verification:** TLC output shows "Model checking completed. No error has been found."

---

### â–¡ Provide Formalizations in Report

**Requirement:** "Provide formalisations of the properties of interest (except Deadlock) in your report, and motivate your choices."

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Report Location:** `reports/single_model_results.md`

Each property includes:
1. âœ… TLA+ formula
2. âœ… English description
3. âœ… Motivation for the chosen formalization
4. âœ… Explanation of how it works

---

### â–¡ Ensure Orientation-Agnostic

**Requirement:** "Make sure that your model works for both lock orientations ('west_low' and 'east_low'). In particular the properties mentioning lower/higher doors should work for both lock orientations."

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Implementation:**
- Uses `LowSide(lockOrientation)` and `HighSide(lockOrientation)` helper functions
- All properties reference these functions instead of hardcoded sides

**Verification:**
1. âœ… Tested with `lockOrientation = "west_low"` â†’ All properties PASS
2. âœ… Tested with `lockOrientation = "east_low"` â†’ All properties PASS

**Report Section:** "Orientation-Agnostic Design" with detailed explanation

---

### â–¡ Classify Properties (Safety vs Liveness)

**Requirement:** "For each property (except Deadlock), state whether it is a safety or a liveness property. Briefly justify your answer."

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Report Location:** Each property section in `reports/single_model_results.md`

| Property | Classification | Justification Provided |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| TypeOK | Safety | âœ… "Something bad never happens" |
| MessagesOK | Safety | âœ… Prevents queue overflow |
| DoorsMutex | Safety | âœ… Both doors never open simultaneously |
| DoorsOpenValvesClosed | Safety | âœ… Prevents unsafe water flow |
| DoorsOpenWaterlevelRight | Safety | âœ… Prevents dangerous water level mismatch |
| RequestLockFulfilled | Liveness | âœ… "Something good eventually happens" |
| WaterlevelChange | Liveness | âœ… Progress property - infinite changes |
| RequestsShips | Liveness | âœ… Infinite requests made |
| ShipsReachGoals | Liveness | âœ… Goals reached infinitely often |

---

### â–¡ Add Properties to Model Configuration

**Requirement:** "Add each property to either `Invariants` or `Properties` in `model_single` depending on their type (safety or liveness property)."

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Configuration File:** `lock_system.toolbox/model_single/MC.cfg`

**INVARIANT Section:**
```
TypeOK
MessagesOK
DoorsMutex
DoorsOpenValvesClosed
DoorsOpenWaterlevelRight
```

**PROPERTY Section:**
```
RequestLockFulfilled
WaterlevelChange
RequestsShips
ShipsReachGoals
```

---

### â–¡ Describe Verification Outcome

**Requirement:** "Describe in your report the outcome of verifying each property: do the above properties hold in your single lock model?"

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Report Location:** Summary table and individual property sections

**Results:**
- âœ… Deadlock: PASS
- âœ… TypeOK: PASS
- âœ… MessagesOK: PASS
- âœ… DoorsMutex: PASS
- âœ… DoorsOpenValvesClosed: PASS
- âœ… DoorsOpenWaterlevelRight: PASS
- âœ… RequestLockFulfilled: PASS (with WF)
- âœ… WaterlevelChange: PASS (with WF)
- âœ… RequestsShips: PASS (with WF)
- âœ… ShipsReachGoals: PASS (with WF)

**All properties hold in the model.**

---

### â–¡ Specify Fairness Requirements

**Requirement:** "Specify which properties only hold under weak fairness and which only under strong fairness. For these properties, justify why weak/strong fairness is needed and why default behavior is not sufficient."

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Report Location:** "Fairness Requirements" section with detailed justification

**Summary:**

| Property | Fairness Required | Detailed Justification |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Safety Invariants (5) | None | âœ… Always hold |
| RequestLockFulfilled | Weak Fairness (WF) | âœ… Provided |
| WaterlevelChange | Weak Fairness (WF) | âœ… Provided |
| RequestsShips | Weak Fairness (WF) | âœ… Provided |
| ShipsReachGoals | Weak Fairness (WF) | âœ… Provided |

**Fairness Specification:**
```tla
FairSpec == Spec 
            /\ WF_vars(controlProcess)
            /\ \A l \in Locks : WF_vars(lockProcess(l))
            /\ \A s \in Ships : WF_vars(shipProcess(s))
```

**Justifications include:**
- âœ… Why WF is needed for each process (control, lock, ship)
- âœ… Why WF is sufficient (continuously enabled actions)
- âœ… Why SF is not needed (no intermittent enabling)
- âœ… Why default behavior fails (allows infinite stuttering)

---

### â–¡ Provide State Space Size and Time

**Requirement:** "Provide the state space size of your model and the time it took to perform all checks."

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Metrics Provided:**

**Configuration: west_low**
- States Generated: 182
- Distinct States: 154
- Total States (with temporal): 308
- Depth: 128
- Time: 1 second
